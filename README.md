## Features üéÆ

- **Sliding Mechanics**
  - Drag and drop entire rows or columns (horizontal/vertical).
  - Edge-wrapping for continuous play.
  - Visual preview system (currently: measuring tape indicator for sliding).

- **Cog System**
  - ~20% of pieces are color-matched cogs.
  - Cogs only spin when orthogonally connected to other cogs.
  - Checkerboard pattern determines rotation direction (even: clockwise, odd: counterclockwise).
  - Interlocking animation: adjacent cogs spin in opposite directions.
  - Score multipliers: each linked cog in a match increases your multiplier.

- **Dynamic Configuration**
  - Real-time settings panel (no restart needed) for:
    - Match length (3-5)
    - Grid size (6x6 to 10x10)
    - Cog density (10%-40%)
    - Base score (100-500)
    - Animation speed (0.5x-2x)

- **Technical Stack**
  - HTML5 Canvas rendering
  - JavaScript game logic
  - CSS-powered UI/animations
  - Mobile-responsive design

## Current State üöß

**Recent Updates (June 2025):**
- ‚úÖ Fully functional drag-and-drop controls
- ‚úÖ Cog meshing system with physics-based animations
- ‚úÖ Real-time settings panel
- ‚úÖ Score multiplier system (2x-5x via cog chains)

## Known Issues ‚ö†Ô∏è

- Occasional animation jitter during rapid row/column swaps
- Mobile touch controls require optimization
- Sliding visuals currently use a "measuring tape" style indicator (temporary)
